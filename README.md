# OceanID

This is a personal project of mine (in a very early stage)

## REQUIRED MODULES

To install the required modules using a virtual environment:

> ```
> python3 -m venv env_name
> source env_name/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

## USE

Clone the repository using:

> ```
> git clone https://github.com/fergascod/oceanID.git
> ```

This will create a directory called `Bird-song-learner` with everything you need to play the Bird Song Learner game.

Move into the directory we just created using:

> ```
> cd oceanID
> ```

Then just execute the Flask app:
> ```
> flask --app app run
> ```

The program will be running in http://127.0.0.1:5000 use your browser of choice to open the app.
